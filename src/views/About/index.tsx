          The only service we provide is to connect Students and Teachers so
          that they can practice yoga. We do not take comission on classes, but
          running our service is not cost free. Development, hosting,
          infrastructure, marketing and more all have associated costs. We've
          put together a few options for helping support The Yoga Collective so
          that we can continue to provide this platform. Thank you for your
          consideration!
